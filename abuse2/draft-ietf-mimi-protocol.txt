   More Instant Messaging Interoperability (MIMI) using HTTPS and MLS
                    draft-ietf-mimi-protocol-latest

Abstract

   This document specifies the More Instant Messaging Interoperability
   (MIMI) transport protocol, which allows users of different messaging
   providers to interoperate in group chats (rooms), including to send
   and receive messages, share room policy, and add participants to and
   remove participants from rooms.  MIMI describes messages between
   providers, leaving most aspects of the provider-internal client-
   server communication up to the provider.  MIMI integrates the
   Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol to provide end-to-end
   security assurances, including authentication of protocol
   participants, confidentiality of messages exchanged within a room,
   and agreement on the state of the room.

1.  Introduction

   The More Instant Messaging Interoperability (MIMI) transport protocol
   enables providers of end-to-end encrypted instant messaging to
   interoperate.  As described in the MIMI architecture
   [I-D.barnes-mimi-arch], group chats and direct messages are described
   in terms of "rooms".  Each MIMI protocol room is hosted at a single
   provider (the "hub" provider"), but allows users from different
   providers to become participants in the room.  The hub provider is
   responsible for ordering and distributing messages, enforcing policy,
   and authorizing messages.  It also keeps a copy of the room state,
   which includes the room policy and participant list, which it can
   provide to new joiners.  Each provider also stores initial keying
   material for its own users (who may be offline).

   This document describes the communication among different providers
   necessary to support messaging application functionality, for
   example:

   *  Sharing room policy

   *  Adding and removing participants in a room

   *  Exchanging secure messages

   In support of these functions, the protocol also has primitives to
   fetch initial keying material and fetch the current state of the
   underlying end-to-end encryption protocol for the room.

   Messages sent inside each room are end-to-end encrypted using the
   Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol [RFC9420], and each room is
   associated with an MLS group.  MLS also ensures that clients in a
   room agree on the room policy and participation.  MLS is integrated
   into MIMI in such a way as to ensure that a client is joined to a
   room's MLS group only if the client's user is a participant in the
   room, and that all clients in the group agree on the state of the
   room (including, for example, the room's participant list).

1.1.  Known Gaps

   In this version of the document, we have tried to capture enough
   concrete functionality to enable basic application functionality,
   while defining enough of a protocol framework to indicate how to add
   other necessary functionality.  The following functions are likely to
   be needed by the complete protocol, but are not covered here:

   Authorization policy:  In this document, we introduce a notional
      concept of roles for participants, and permissions for roles.
      Actual messaging systems have more complex and well-specified
      authorization policies about which clients can take which actions
      in a room.

   Advanced join/leave flows:  In this document, all adds / removes /
      joins / leaves are initiated from within the group, or by a new
      joiner who already has permission to join, as this aligns well
      with MLS.  Messaging applications support a variety of other
      flows, some of which this protocol will need to support.

   Identifiers:  Certain entities in the MIMI system need to be
      identified in the protocol.  In this document, we define a
      notional syntax for identifiers, but a more concrete one should be
      defined.

   Abuse reporting:  There is no mechanism in this document for
      reporting abusive behavior to a messaging provider.

   Identifier resolution:  In some cases, the identifier used to
      initiate communications with a user might be different from the
      identifier that should be used internally.  For example, a user-
      visible handle might need to be mapped to a durable internal
      identifier.  This document provides no mechanism for such
      resolution.

   Authentication  While MLS provides basic message authentication,
      users should also be able to (cryptographically) tie the identity
      of other users to their respective providers.  Further
      authentication such as tying clients to their users (or the user's
      other clients) may also be desirable.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Terms and definitions are inherited from [I-D.barnes-mimi-arch].  We
   also make use of terms from the MLS protocol [RFC9420].

   Throughout this document, the examples use the TLS Presentation
   Language [RFC8446] and the semantics of HTTP [RFC7231] respectively
   as placeholder a set of binary encoding mechanism and transport
   semantics.

   The protocol layering of the MIMI transport protocol is as follows:

   1.  An application layer that enables messaging functionality

   2.  A security layer that provides end-to-end security guarantees:

       *  Confidentiality for messages

       *  Authentication of actors making changes to rooms

       *  Agreement on room state across the clients involved in a room

   3.  A transport layer that provides secure delivery of protocol
       objects between servers.

                      Figure 1: MIMI protocol layering

   MIMI uses MLS for end-to-end security, using the MLS AppSync proposal
   type to efficiently synchronize room state across the clients
   involved in a room [RFC9420] [I-D.barnes-mls-appsync].  The MIMI
   transport is based on HTTPS over mutually-authenticated TLS.

3.  Example protocol flow

   This section walks through a basic scenario that illustrates how a
   room works in the MIMI protocol.  The scenario involves the following
   actors:

   *  Service providers a.example, b.example, and c.example represented
      by servers ServerA, ServerB, and ServerC respectively

   *  Users Alice (alice), Bob (bob) and Cathy (cathy) of the service
      providers a.example, b.example, and c.example respectively.

   *  Clients ClientA1, ClientA2, ClientB1, etc. belonging to these
      users

   *  A room clubhouse hosted by hub provider a.example where the three
      users interact.

   Inside the protocol, each provider is represented by a domain name in
   the host production of the authority of a MIMI URI [RFC3986].
   Specific hosts or servers are represented by domain names, but not by
   MIMI URIs.  Examples of different types of identifiers represented in
   a MIMI URI are shown in the table below:

            +=================+==============================+
            | Identifier type | Example URI                  |
            +=================+==============================+
            | Provider        | mimi://a.example             |
            +-----------------+------------------------------+
            | User            | mimi://a.example/u/alice     |
            +-----------------+------------------------------+
            | Client          | mimi://a.example/d/ClientA1  |
            +-----------------+------------------------------+
            | Room            | mimi://a.example/r/clubhouse |
            +-----------------+------------------------------+
            | MLS group       | mimi://a.example/g/clubhouse |
            +-----------------+------------------------------+

                        Table 1: MIMI URI examples

   As noted in [I-D.barnes-mimi-arch], the MIMI protocol only defines
   interactions between service providers' servers.  Interactions
   between clients and servers within a service provider domain are
   shown here for completeness, but surrounded by [[ double brackets ]].

3.1.  Alice Creates a Room

   The first step in the lifetime of a MIMI room is its creation on the
   hub server.  This operation is local to the service provider, and
   does not entail any MIMI protocol operations.  However, it must
   establish the initial state of the room, which is then the basis for
   protocol operations related to the room.

   For authorization purposes, MIMI uses permissions based on room-
   defined roles.  For example, a room might have a role named "admin",
   which has canAddUser, canRemoveUser, and canSetUserRole permisions.

   Here, we assume that Alice uses ClientA1 to create a room with the
   following base policy properties:

   *  Room Identifier: mimi://a.example/r/clubhouse

   *  Roles: admin = [canAddUser, canRemoveUser, canSetUserRole]

   And the following participant list:

   *  Participants: [[mimi://a.example/u/alice, "admin"]]

   ClientA1 also creates an MLS group with group ID mimi://a.example/g/
   clubhouse and ensures via provider-local operations that Alice's
   other clients are members of this MLS group.

3.2.  Alice adds Bob to the Room

   Adding Bob to the room entails operations at two levels.  First,
   Bob's user identity must be added to the room's participant list.
   Second, Bob's clients must be added to the room's MLS group.

   The process of adding Bob to the room thus begins by Alice fetching
   key material for Bob's clients.  Alice then updates the room by
   sending an MLS Commit over the following proposals:

   *  An AppSync proposal updating the room state by adding Bob to the
      participant list

   *  Add proposals for Bob's clients

   The MIMI protocol interactions are between Alice's server ServerA and
   Bob's server ServerB.  ServerB stores KeyPackages on behalf of Bob's
   devices.  ServerA performs the key material fetch on Alice's behalf,
   and delivers the resulting KeyPackages to Alice's clients.  Both
   ServerA and ServerB remember the sources of the KeyPackages they
   handle, so that they can route a Welcome message for those
   KeyPackages to the proper recipients -- ServerA to ServerB, and
   ServerB to Bob's clients.

      *NOTE:* In the protocol, it is necessary to have consent (see
      Section 7) and access control on these operations.  We have elided
      that step here in the interest of simplicity.

3.3.  Bob adds Cathy to the Room

   The process of adding Bob was a bit abbreviated because Alice is a
   user of the hub service provider.  When Bob adds Cathy, we see the
   full process, involving the same two steps (KeyPackage fetch followed
   by Add), but this time indirected via the hub server ServerA.  Also,
   now that there are users on ServerB involved in the room, the hub
   ServerA will have to distribute the Commit adding Cathy and Cathy's
   clients to ServerB as well as forwarding the Welcome to ServerC.

3.4.  Cathy Sends a Message

   Now that Alice, Bob, and Cathy are all in the room, Cathy wants to
   say hello to everyone.  Cathy's client encapsulates the message in an
   MLS PrivateMessage and sends it to ServerC, who forwards it to the
   hub ServerA on Cathy's behalf.  Assuming Cathy is allowed to speak in
   the room, ServerA will forward Cathy's message to the other servers
   involved in the room, who distribute it to their clients.

3.5.  Bob Leaves the Room

   A user removing another user follows the same flow as adding the
   user.  The user performing the removal creates an MLS commit covering
   Remove proposals for all of the removed user's devices, and an
   AppSync proposal updating the room state to remove the removed user
   from the room's participant list.

   One's own user leaving is slightly more complicated than removing
   another user, because the leaving user cannot remove all of their
   devices from the MLS group.  Instead, the leave happens in three
   steps:

   1.  The leaving client constructs MLS Remove proposals for all of the
       user's devices (including the leaving client), and an AppSync
       proposal that removes its user from the participant list.

   2.  The leaving client sends these proposals to the hub.  The hub
       caches the proposals.

   3.  The next time a client attempts to commit, the hub requires the
       client to include the cached proposals.

   The hub thus guarantees the leaving client that they will be removed
   as soon as possible.

3.6.  Cathy adds a new device

   Many users have multiple clients often running on different devices
   (for example a phone, a tablet, and a computer).  When a user creates
   a new client, that client needs to be able to join all the MLS groups
   associated with the rooms in which the user is a participant.

   In MLS in order to initiate joining a group the joining client needs
   to get the current GroupInfo and ratchet_tree, and then send an
   External Commit to the hub.  In MIMI, the hub keeps or reconstructs a
   copy of the GroupInfo, assuming that other clients may not be
   available to assist the client with joining.

   For Cathy's new client (ClientC3) to join the MLS group and therefore
   fully participate in the room with Alice, ClientC3 needs to fetch the
   MLS GroupInfo, and then generate an External Commit adding ClientC3.

   Cathy's new client sends the External Commit to the room's MLS group
   by sending an /update to the room.

4.  Services required at each layer

4.1.  Transport layer

   MIMI servers communicate using HTTPS.  The HTTP request MUST identify
   the source and target providers for the request, in the following
   way:

   *  The target provider is indicated using a Host header [RFC9110].
      If the provider is using a non-standard port, then the port
      component of the Host header is ignored.

   *  The source provider is indicated using a From header [RFC9110].
      The mailbox production in the From header MUST use the addr-spec
      variant, and the local-part of the address MUST contain the fixed
      string mimi.  Thus, the content of the From header will be
      mimi@a.example, where a.example is the domain name of the source
      provider.

      *NOTE*: The use of the From header field here is not really well-
      aligned with its intended use.  The WG should consider whether
      this is correct, or whether a new header field would be better.
      Perhaps something like "From-Host" to match Host?

   The TLS connection underlying the HTTPS connection MUST be mutually
   authenticated.  The certificates presented in the TLS handshake MUST
   authenticate the source and target provider domains, according to
   [RFC6125].

   The bodies of HTTP requests and responses are defined by the
   individual endpoints defined in Section 4.3.

4.2.  End-to-End Security Layer

   Every MIMI room has an MLS group associated to it, which provides
   end-to-end security guarantees.  The clients participating in the
   room manage the MLS-level membership by sending Commit messages
   covering Add and Remove proposals.

   Every application message sent within a room is authenticated and
   confidentiality-protected by virtue of being encapsulated in an MLS
   PrivateMessage object.

   MIMI uses the MLS application state synchronization mechanism
   ([I-D.barnes-mls-appsync]) to ensure that the clients involved in a
   MIMI room agree on the state of the room.  Each MIMI message that
   changes the state of the room is encapsulated in an AppSync proposal
   and transmitted inside an MLS PublicMessage object.

   The PublicMessage encapsulation provides sender authentication,
   including the ability for actors outside the group (e.g., servers
   involved in the room) to originate AppSync proposals.  Encoding room
   state changes in MLS proposals ensures that a client will not process
   a commit that confirms a state change before processing the state
   change itself.

      *TODO*: A little more needs to be said here about how MLS is used.
      For example: What types of credential are required / allowed?  If
      servers are going to be allowed to introduce room changes, how are
      their keys provisioned as external signers?  Need to maintain the
      membership and the list of queued proposals.

4.3.  Application Layer

   Servers in MIMI provide a few functions that enable messaging
   applications.  All servers act as publication points for key material
   used to add their users to rooms.  The hub server for a room tracks
   the state of the room, and controls how the room's state evolves,
   e.g., by ensuring that changes are compliant with the room's policy.
   Non-hub servers facilitate interactions between their clients and the
   hub server.

   In this section, we describe the state that servers keep.  The
   following top level section describes the HTTP endpoints exposed to
   enable these functions.

4.3.1.  Server State

   Every MIMI server is a publication point for users' key material, via
   the keyMaterial endpoint discussed in Section 5.2.  To support this
   endpoint, the server stores a set of KeyPackages, where each
   KeyPackage belongs to a specific user and device.

   Each KeyPackage includes a list of its MLS client's capabilities (MLS
   protocol versions, cipher suites, extensions, proposal types, and
   credential types).  When claiming KeyPackages, the requester includes
   the list of RequiredCapabilites to ensure the new joiner is
   compatible with and capable of participating in the corresponding
   room.

   The hub server for the room stores the state of the room, comprising:

   *  The _base policy_ of the room, which does not depend on the
      specific participants in the room.  For example, this includes the
      room roles and their permissions.

   *  The _participant list_: a list of the users who are participants
      of the room, and each user's role in the room.

      *TODO*: We need a more full description of the room, room state
      syntax.

   When a client requests key material via the hub, the hub records the
   KeyPackageRef values for the returned KeyPackages, and the identity
   of the provider from which they were received.  This information is
   then used to route Welcome message to the proper provider.

4.3.2.  Participant List Changes

   The participant list can be changed by adding or removing users, or
   changing a user's role.  These changes are described without a
   specific syntax as a list of adds, removes, and role changes:

   Add: ["mimi://d.example/u/diana", "admin"],
        ["mimi://e.example/u/eric", "admin"],
   Remove: ["mimi://b.example/u/bob"],
   SetRole: [["mimi://c.example/u/cathy", "admin"]]

                  Figure 9: Changing the state of the room

   To put these changes into effect, a client or server encodes them in
   an AppSync proposal, signs the proposal as a PublicMessage, and
   submits them to the update endpoint on the hub.

5.  MIMI Endpoints and Framing

   This section describes the specific endpoints necessary to provide
   the functionality in the example flow.  The framing for each endpoint
   includes a protocol so that different variations of the end-to-end
   encryption can be used.

      *TODO*: Determine the what needs to be included in the protocol.
      MIMI version, e2e protocol version, etc.

   The syntax of the MIMI protocol messages are described using the TLS
   presentation language format (Section 3 of [RFC8446]).

   enum {
       reserved(0),
       mls10(1),
       (255)
   } Protocol;

5.1.  Directory

   Like the ACME protocol (See Section 7.1.1 of [RFC8555]), the MIMI
   protocol uses a directory document to convey the HTTPS URLs used to
   reach certain endpoints (as opposed to hard coding the endpoints).

   The directory URL is discovered using the mimi-protocol-directory
   well-known URI.  The response is a JSON document with URIs for each
   type of endpoint.

   GET /.well-known/mimi-protocol-directory

   {
     "keyMaterial":
        "https://mimi.example.com/v1/keyMaterial/{targetUser}",
     "update": "https://mimi.example.com/v1/update{roomId}",
     "notify": "https://mimi.example.com/v1/notify/{roomId}",
     "submitMessage":
        "https://mimi.example.com/v1/submitMessage/{roomId}",
     "groupInfo":
        "https://mimi.example.com/v1/groupInfo/{roomId}",
     "requestConsent":
        "https://mimi.example.com/v1/requestConsent/{targetUser}",
     "updateConsent":

   }

5.2.  Fetch Key Material

   This action attempts to claim initial keying material for all the
   clients of a single user at a specific provider.  The keying material
   is designed for use in a single room and may not be reused.  It uses
   the HTTP POST method.

   POST /keyMaterial/{targetUser}

   The target user's URI is listed in the request path.  KeyPackages
   requested using this primitive MUST be sent via the hub provider of
   whatever room they will be used in.  (If this is not the case, the
   hub provider will be unable to forward a Welcome message to the
   target provider).

   The path includes the target user.  The request body includes the
   protocol (currently just MLS 1.0), and the requesting user.  When the
   request is being made in the context of adding the target user to a
   room, the request MUST include the room ID for which the KeyPackage
   is intended, as the target may have only granted consent for a
   specific room.

   For MLS, the request includes a non-empty list of acceptable MLS
   ciphersuites, and an MLS RequiredCapabilities object (which contains
   credential types, non-default proposal types, and extensions)
   required by the requesting provider (these lists can be an empty).

   The request body has the following form.

   struct {
       opaque uri<V>;
   } IdentifierUri;

   struct {
       Protocol protocol;
       IdentifierUri requestingUser;
       IdentifierUri targetUser;
       IdentifierUri roomId;
       select (protocol) {
           case mls10:
               CipherSuite acceptableCiphersuites<V>;
               RequiredCapabilities requiredCapabilities;
       };
   } KeyMaterialRequest;

   The response contains a user status code that indicates keying
   material was returned for all the user's clients (success), that
   keying material was returned for some of their clients
   (partialSuccess), or a specific user code indicating failure.  If the
   user code is success or partialSuccess, each client is enumerated in
   the response.  Then for each client with a _client_ success code, the
   structure includes initial keying material (a KeyPackage for MLS
   1.0).  If the client's code is nothingCompatible, the client's
   capabilities are optionally included (The client's capabilities could
   be omitted for privacy reasons.)

   If the _user_ code is noCompatibleMaterial, the provider MAY populate
   the clients list.  For any other user code, the provider MUST NOT
   populate the clients list.

   Keying material provided from one response MUST NOT be provided in
   any other response.  The target provider MUST NOT provide expired
   keying material (ex: an MLS KeyPackage containing a LeafNode with a
   notAfter time past the current date and time).

   enum {
       success(0);
       partialSuccess(1);
       incompatibleProtocol(2);
       noCompatibleMaterial(3);
       userUnknown(4);
       noConsent(5);
       noConsentForThisRoom(6);
       userDeleted(7);
       (255)
   } KeyMaterialUserCode;

   enum {
       success(0);
       keyMaterialExhausted(1),
       nothingCompatible(2),
       (255)
   } KeyMaterialClientCode;


   struct {
       KeyMaterialClientCode clientStatus;
       IdentifierUri clientUri;
       select (protocol) {
           case mls10:
               select (clientStatus) {
                   case success:
                       KeyPackage keyPackage;
                   case nothingCompatible:
                       optional<Capabilities> clientCapabilities;
               };
       };
   } ClientKeyMaterial;

   struct {
       Protocol protocol;
       KeyMaterialUserCode userStatus;
       IdentifierUri userUri;
       ClientKeyMaterial clients<V>;
   } KeyMaterialResponse;

   The semantics of the KeyMaterialUserCode are as follows:

   *  success indicates that key material was provided for every client
      of the target user.

   *  partialSuccess indicates that key material was provided for at
      least one client of the target user.

   *  incompatibleProtocol indicates that either one of providers
      supports the protocol requested, or none of the clients of the
      target user support the protocol requested.

   *  noCompatibleMaterial indicates that none of the clients was able
      to supply key material compatible with the requiredCapabilities
      field in the request.

   *  userUnknown indicates that the target user is not known to the
      target provider.

   *  noConsent indicates that the requester does not have consent to
      fetch key material for the target user.  The target provider can
      use this response as a catch all and in place of other status
      codes such as userUnknown if desired to preserve the privacy of
      its users.

   *  noConsentForThisRoom indicates that the target user might have
      allowed a request for another room, but does not for this room.
      If the provider does not wish to make this distinction, it can
      return noConsent instead.

   *  userDeleted indicates that the target provider wishes the
      requester to know that the target user was previously a valid user
      of the system and has been deleted.  A target provider can of
      course use userUnknown if the provider does wish to keep or
      specify this distinction.

   The semantics of the KeyMaterialClientCode are as follows:

   *  success indicates that key material was provided for the specified
      client.

   *  keyMaterialExhausted indicates that there was no keying material
      available for the specified client.

   *  nothingCompatible indicates that the specified clients had no key
      material compatible with the requiredCapabilities field in the
      request.

   At minimum, as each MLS KeyPackage is returned to a requesting
   provider (on behalf of a requesting IM client), the target provider
   needs to associate its KeyPackageRef with the target client and the
   hub provider needs to associate its KeyPackageRef with the target
   provider.  This ensures that Welcome messages can be correctly routed
   to the target provider and client.  These associations can be deleted
   after a Welcome message is forwarded or after the KeyPackage
   leaf_node.lifetime.not_after time has passed.

5.3.  Update Room State

   Adds, removes, and policy changes to the room are all forms of
   updating the room state.  They are accomplished using the update
   transaction which is used to update the room base policy,
   participation list, or its underlying MLS group.  It uses the HTTP
   POST method.

   POST /update/{roomId}

   Any change to the participant list or room policy (including
   authorization policy) is communicated via an AppSync proposal type
   with the applicationId of mimiParticipantList or mimiRoomPolicy
   respectively.  When adding a user, the proposal containing the
   participant list change MUST be committed either before or
   simultaneously with the corresponding MLS operation.

   Removing an active user from a participant list or banning an active
   participant likewise also happen simultaneously with any MLS changes
   made to the commit removing the participant.

   A hub provider which observes that an active participant has been
   removed or banned from the room, MUST prevent any of its clients from
   sending or receiving any additional application messages in the
   corresponding MLS group; MUST prevent any of those clients from
   sending Commit messages in that group; and MUST prevent it from
   sending any proposals except for Remove and SelfRemove
   [I-D.ietf-mls-extensions] proposals for its users in that group.

   The update request body is described below:

   enum {
     reserved(0),
     full(1),
     (255)
   } RatchetTreeRepresentation;

   struct {
     RatchetTreeRepresentation representation;
     select (representation) {
       case full:
         Node ratchet_tree<V>;
     };
   } RatchetTreeOption;

   struct {
     /* A Proposal or Commit which is either a PublicMessage; */
     /* or a SemiPrivateMessage                               */
     MLSMessage proposalOrCommit;
     select (proposalOrCommit.content.content_type) {
       case commit:
         /* Both the Welcome and GroupInfo omit the ratchet_tree */
         optional<Welcome> welcome;
         GroupInfo groupInfo;
         RatchetTreeOption ratchetTreeOption;
       case proposal:
         /* a list of additional proposals, each represented */
         /* as either PublicMessage or SemiPrivateMessage    */
         MLSMessage moreProposals<V>;
   } HandshakeBundle;

   struct {
     select (room.protocol) {
       case mls10:
         HandshakeBundle bundle;
     };
   } UpdateRequest;

   For example, in the first use case described in the Protocol
   Overview, Alice creates a Commit containing an AppSync proposal
   adding Bob (mimi://b.example/b/bob), and Add proposals for all Bob's
   MLS clients.  Alice includes the Welcome message which will be sent
   for Bob, a GroupInfo object for the hub provider, and complete
   ratchet_tree extension.

   A handshake message could be sent by the client as an MLS
   PublicMessage (which is visible to all providers), or as an MLS
   SemiPrivateMessage [I-D.mahy-mls-semiprivatemessage] encrypted for
   the members and the hub provider as the sole external_receiver.  (The
   contents and sender of a SemiPrivateMessage would not be visible to
   other providers).  The use of SemiPrivateMessage allows the Hub to
   accomplish its policy enforcement responsibilities without the other
   providers being aware of the membership of non-local users.

   The response body is described below:

   enum {
     success(0),
     wrongEpoch(1),
     notAllowed(2),
     invalidProposal(3),
     (255)
   } UpdateResponseCode;

   struct {
     UpdateResponseCode responseCode;
     string errorDescription;
     select (responseCode) {
       case success:
         /* the hub acceptance time (in milliseconds from the UNIX epoch) */
         uint64 acceptedTimestamp;
       case wrongEpoch:
         /* current MLS epoch for the MLS group */
         uint64 currentEpoch;
       case invalidProposal:
         ProposalRef invalidProposals<V>;
     };
   } UpdateRoomResponse

   The semantics of the UpdatedResponseCode values are as follows:

   *  success indicates the UpdateRequest was accepted and will be
      distributed.

   *  wrongEpoch indicates that the hub provider is using a different
      epoch.  The currentEpoch is provided in the response.

   *  notAllowed indicates that some type of policy or authorization
      prevented the hub provider from accepting the UpdateRequest.

   *  invalidProposal indicates that at least one proposal is invalid.
      A list of invalidProposals is provided in the response.

5.4.  Submit a Message

   End-to-end encrypted (application) messages are submitted to the hub
   for authorization and eventual fanout using an HTTP POST request.

   POST /submitMessage/{roomId}

   The request body is as follows:

   struct {
     Protocol protocol;
     select(protocol) {
       case mls10:
         /* PrivateMessage containing an application message */
         MLSMessage appMessage;
         IdentifierURI sendingUri;
     };
   } SubmitMessageRequest;

   If the protocol is MLS 1.0, the request body (appMessage) is an
   MLSMessage with a WireFormat of PrivateMessage, and a content_type of
   application.  The sendingUri is a valid URI of the sender and is an
   active participant in the room.

   The response indicates if the message was accepted by the hub
   provider.  If a frankingTag was included in the FrankAAD extension in
   the PrivateMessage Additional Authenticated Data (AAD) in the
   request, the server attempts to frank the message and includes the
   serverFrank in a successful response (see the next subsection).

   enum {
     accepted(0),
     notAllowed(1),
     epochTooOld(2),
     (255)
   } SubmitResponseCode;

   struct {
     Protocol protocol;
     select(protocol) {
       case mls10:
         SubmitResponseCode statusCode;
         select (statusCode) {
           case success:
             /* the hub acceptance time
                (in milliseconds from the UNIX epoch) */
             uint64 acceptedTimestamp;
             optional uint8[32] serverFrank;
           case epochTooOld:
             /* current MLS epoch for the MLS group */
             uint64 currentEpoch;
         };
     };
   } SubmitMessageResponse;

   The semantics of the SubmitResponseCode values are as follows:

   *  success indicates the SubmitMessageRequest was accepted and will
      be distributed.

   *  notAllowed indicates that some type of policy or authorization
      prevented the hub provider from accepting the UpdateRequest.  This
      could include nonsensical inputs such as an MLS epoch more recent
      than the hub's.

   *  epochTooOld indicates that the hub provider is using a new MLS
      epoch for the group.  The currentEpoch is provided in the
      response.

      *ISSUE:* Do we want to offer a distinction between regular
      application messages and ephemeral applications messages (for
      example "is typing" notifications), which do not need to be queued
      at the target provider.

5.4.1.  Message Franking

   Franking is the placing of a cryptographic "stamp" on a message.  In
   the MIMI context, the Hub is able to mark that it received a message
   without learning the message content.  A receiver that decrypts the
   message can use a valid frank to prove it was received by the Hub and
   that the content was sent by a specific sender.  Outsiders (including
   follower providers) never learn the content of the message, nor the
   sender.

   Franking was popularized by Facebook and described in their
   whitepaper [SecretConversations] about their end-to-end encryption
   system.  This franking mechanism is largely motivated by that
   solution with two significant changes as discussed in the final
   paragraph of this section.

5.4.1.1.  Client creation and sending

   When ready to send an application message with the MIMI content
   format, the sender generates a new cryptographically random 256-bit
   franking_key.  An example mechanism to generate the franking_key
   safely is discussed in Section 8.1.1.

   Next the sender attaches to the message the franking_key and any
   other fields the sender wishes to commit that are not otherwise
   represented in the content.  For a MIMI content object, the sender
   creates a CBOR "FrankingAssertion" map containing the franking_key,
   sender URI, and room URI.  It adds this FrankingAssertion to the
   extensions map at the top level of the MIMI content using the integer
   key TBD1.

   / FrankingAssertion map /
   {
     / FrankingKey    / 1: h'9c8af7674941aa95f8df37bd36ea89f2
                             a3ab433aa5baa8e5e465f08a7e8e3b57',
     / SenderURI      / 2: "mimi://b.example/u/alice",
     / RoomURI        / 3: "mimi://hub.example/r/Rl33FWLCYWOwxHrYnpWDQg",
   }

   Note that this assertion does not vouch for the validity of these
   values, it just means that the sender is claiming it sent the values
   in the content, and cannot later deny to a receiver that it sent
   them.

   Then the client calculates the franking_tag, as the HMAC SHA256 of
   the application_data (which includes the FrankingAssertion
   extension), using the franking_key:

   franking_tag = HMAC_SHA256( franking_key, application_data)

   The client includes the franking_tag in the Additional Authenticated
   Data of the MLS PrivateMessage using the Safe Extension FrankAAD.
   The client uses the MIMI submitMessage to send its message, and also
   asserts a sender identity to the Hub, which could be a valid
   pseudonym, and needs to match the sender URI value embedded in the
   message.  If the message is accepted, the response includes the
   accepted timestamp and the serverFrank (generated by the server).

5.4.1.2.  Hub processing

   The Hub relies on a per-epoch secret shared among the members of the
   group and itself to obfuscate the message metadata (the context) the
   Hub uses while franking.  It derives the franking_context_secret
   (with the label "franking_context") from the ap_exporter_secret in
   the Associated Party Key Schedule
   [I-D.kohbrok-mls-associated-parties].

   When the Hub receives an acceptable application message with the
   FrankAAD AAD extension and a valid sender identity, it calculates a
   server frank for the message as follows:

   context = senderURI || roomURI || acceptedTimestamp
   serverFrank = HMAC_SHA256(HUBkey, franking_tag || context )
   franking_context_hash = SHA256(franking_context_secret || context)

   HUBkey is a secret symmetric key used on the Hub which the Hub can
   use to verify its own tags.

   The Hub fans out the encrypted message (which includes the
   franking_tag), the serverFrank, the acceptedTimestamp, the room URI,
   and the franking_context_hash.  Note that the senderURI is not
   included in the application message, so the sender can remain
   anonymous with respect to follower providers.

5.4.1.3.  Receiver verification of frank

   When a client receives and decrypts an otherwise valid application
   message from a hub provider, the client looks for the existence of a
   frank (consisting of the franking_tag in the AAD, the serverFrank and
   the franking_context_hash.  If so, it derives the
   franking_context_secret from the ap_exporter_secret in the Associated
   Party Key Schedule [I-D.kohbrok-mls-associated-parties]; then it
   verifies the construction of the franking_tag from the content of the
   message, and the construction of the franking_context_hash from the
   sender URI, room ID, acceptedTimestamp, and franking_context_secret.

   The receiving client receives a sender identifier in three different
   locations.  The receiver verifies that they are all the same:

   *  the sender's identity in its credential in its MLS LeafNode

   *  the sender's identity asserted in the FrankingAssertion map inside
      the MIMI Content

   *  the (hidden) sender's identity in the context used to create the
      serverFrank.  The client hashes the concatenation of the sender's
      identity, the room ID, and the acceptedTimestamp.  If this hash
      matches the context_validation hash, then the identity used by the
      server was correct.

   The receiver needs to store the frank with the decoded message so it
   can be used later.

5.4.1.4.  Comparison with the Facebook franking scheme

   Unlike in the Facebook franking scheme [SecretConversations], the
   sender "commits to" its franking_tag as Additional Authenticated Data
   (AAD) inside the end-to-end encrypted message, and the hub only sends
   a hash of its context.  This first change insures that the client
   cannot come up with another franking_key and message that has the
   same franking_tag [Grubbs2017][InvisibleSalamanders].  According to
   [Grubbs2017], "... [Facebook's] franking scheme does not bind [the
   franking tag] to [the ciphertext] by including [the franking tag] in
   the associated data during encryption".  The second change allows
   receivers to validate the sender URI in the hub's context, without
   revealing the sender URI to follower providers.

5.5.  Fanout Messages and Room Events

   If the hub provider accepts an application or handshake message
   (proposal or commit) message, it forwards that message to all other
   providers with active participants in the room and all local clients
   which are active members.  This is described as fanning the message
   out.  One can think of fanning a message out as presenting an ordered
   list of MLS-protected events to the next "hop" toward the receiving
   client.

   An MLS Welcome message is sent to the providers and local users
   associated with the KeyPackageRef values in the secrets array of the
   Welcome.  In the case of a Welcome message, a RatchetTreeOption is
   also included in the FanoutMessage.

   The hub provider also fans out any messages which originate from
   itself (ex: MLS External Proposals).

   The hub can include multiple concatenated FanoutMessage objects
   relevant to the same room.  This endpoint uses the HTTP POST method.

   POST /notify/{roomId}

   struct {
     uint8[32] franking_tag;
     uint8[32] serverFrank;
     uint8[32] franking_context_hash;
   } Frank;

   struct {
     /* the hub acceptance time (in milliseconds from the UNIX epoch) */
     uint64 timestamp;
     select (protocol) {
       case mls10:
         /* A PrivateMessage containing an application message,
            a PublicMessage containing a proposal or commit,
            or a Welcome message.                               */
         MLSMessage message;
         select (message.wire_format) {
           case application:
              optional Frank frank;
           case welcome:
              RatchetTreeOption ratchetTreeOption;
         };
     };
   } FanoutMessage;

      *NOTE:* Correctly fanning out Welcome messages relies on the hub
      and target providers storing the KeyPackageRef of claimed
      KeyPackages.

   A client which receives a success to either an UpdateRoomResponse or
   a SubmitMessageResponse can view this as a commitment from the hub
   provider that the message will eventually be distributed to the
   group.  The hub is not expected to forward the client's own message
   to the client or its provider.  However, the client and its provider
   need to be prepared to receive the client's (effectively duplicate)
   message.  This situation can occur during failover in high
   availability recovery scenarios.

   Clients that are being removed SHOULD receive the corresponding
   Commit message, so they can recognize that they have been removed and
   clean up their internal state.  A removed client might not receive a
   commit if it was removed as a malicious or abusive client, or if it
   obviously deleted.

   The response to a FanoutMessage contains no body.  The HTTP response
   code indicates if the messages in the request were accepted (201
   response code), or if there was an error.  The hub need not wait for
   a response before sending the next fanout message.

   If the hub server does not contain an HTTP 201 response code, then it
   SHOULD retry the request, respecting any guidance provided by the
   server in HTTP header fields such as Retry-After.  If a follower
   server receives a duplicate request to the /notify endpoint, in the
   sense of a request from the same hub server with the same request
   body as a previous /notify request, then the follower server MUST
   return a 201 Accepted response.  In such cases, the follower server
   SHOULD process only the first request; subsequent duplicate requests
   SHOULD be ignored (despite the success response).

      *NOTE:* These deduplication provisions require follower servers to
      track which request bodies they have received from which hub
      servers.  Since the matching here is byte-exact, it can be done by
      keeping a rolling list of hashes of recent messages.

      This byte-exact replay criterion might not be the right
      deduplication strategy.  There might be situations where it is
      valid for the same hub server to send the same payload multiple
      times, e.g., due to accidental collisions.

      If this is a concern, then an explicit transaction ID could be
      introduced.  The follower server would still have to keep a list
      of recently seen transaction IDs, but deduplication could be done
      irrespective of the content of request bodies.

5.6.  Claim group key information

   When a client joins an MLS group without an existing member adding
   the client to the MLS group, that is called an external join.  This
   is useful a) when a new client of an existing user needs to join the
   groups of all the user's rooms.  It can also be used b) when a client
   did not have key packages available but their user is already in the
   participation list for the corresponding room, c) when joining an
   open room, or d) when joining using an external authentication
   joining code.  In MIMI, external joins are accomplished by fetching
   the MLS GroupInfo for a room's MLS group, and then sending an
   external commit incorporating the GroupInfo.

   The GroupInfoRequest uses the HTTP POST method.

   POST /groupInfo/{roomId}

   The request provides an MLS credential proving the requesting
   client's real or pseudonymous identity.  This user identity is used
   by the hub to correlate this request with the subsequent external
   commit.  The credential may constitute sufficient permission to
   authorize providing the GroupInfo and later joining the group.
   Alternatively, the request can include an optional opaque joining
   code, which the requester could use to prove permission to fetch the
   GroupInfo, even if it is not yet a participant.

   The request also provides a signature public key corresponding to the
   requester's credential.  It also specifies a CipherSuite which merely
   needs to be one ciphersuite in common with the hub.  It is needed
   only to specify the algorithms used to sign the GroupInfoRequest and
   GroupInfoResponse.

   struct {
     Protocol protocol;
     select (protocol) {
       case mls10:
         CipherSuite cipher_suite;
         SignaturePublicKey requestingSignatureKey;
         Credential requestingCredential;
         optional opaque joiningCode<V>;
     };
   } GroupInfoRequestTBS;

   struct {
     Protocol protocol;
     select (protocol) {
       case mls10:
         CipherSuite cipher_suite;
         SignaturePublicKey requestingSignatureKey;
         Credential requestingCredential;
         opaque joiningCode<V>;
         /* SignWithLabel(., "GroupInfoRequestTBS", GroupInfoRequestTBS) */
         opaque signature<V>;
     };
   } GroupInfoRequest;

   If successful, the response body contains the GroupInfo and a way to
   get the ratchet_tree.

   enum {
     reserved(0),
     success(1),
     notAuthorized(2),
     noSuchRoom(3),
     (255)
   } GroupInfoCode;

   struct {
     Protocol version;
     GroupInfoCode status;
     select (protocol) {
       case mls10:
         CipherSuite cipher_suite;
         opaque room_id<V>;
         ExternalSender hub_sender;
         GroupInfo groupInfo;   /* without embedded ratchet_tree */
         RatchetTreeOption ratchetTreeOption;
     };
   } GroupInfoResponseTBS;

   struct {
     Protocol version;
     GroupInfoCode status;
     select (protocol) {
       case mls10:
         CipherSuite cipher_suite;
         opaque room_id<V>;
         ExternalSender hub_sender;
         GroupInfo groupInfo;   /* without embedded ratchet_tree */
         RatchetTreeOption ratchetTreeOption;
         /* SignWithLabel(., "GroupInfoResponseTBS", GroupInfoResponseTBS) */
         opaque signature<V>;
     };
   } GroupInfoResponse;

   The semantics of the GroupInfoCode are as follows:

   *  success indicates that GroupInfo and ratchet tree was provided as
      requested.

   *  notAuthorized indicates that the requester was not authorized to
      access the GroupInfo.

   *  noSuchRoom indicates that the requested room does not exist.  If
      the hub does not want to reveal if a room ID does not exist it can
      use notAuthorized instead.

      *TODO*: Consider adding additional failure codes/semantics for
      joining codes (ex: code expired, already used, invalid)

   *ISSUE*: What security properties are needed to protect a GroupInfo
   object in the MIMI context are still under discussion.  It is
   possible that the requester only needs to prove possession of their
   private key.  The GroupInfo in another context might be sufficiently
   sensitive that it should be encrypted from the end client to the hub
   provider (unreadable by the local provider).

5.7.  Convey explicit consent

   As discussed in Section 7, there are many ways that a provider could
   implicitly determine consent.  This section describes a mechanism by
   which providers can explicitly request consent from a user of another
   provider, cancel such a request, convey that consent was granted, or
   convey that consent was revoked or preemptively denied.

   Since they are not necessarily in the context of a room, consent
   requests are sent directly from the provider of the user requesting
   consent, to the provider of the target user.  (There is no concept of
   a hub outside of the context of a room.)

   POST /requestConsent/{targetDomain}
   POST /updateConsent/{requesterDomain}

   A requestConsent request is used by one provider to request explicit
   consent from a target user at another provider to fetch the target's
   KeyPackages (which is a prerequisite for adding the target to a
   group); or to cancel that request.  The request body is a
   ConsentEntry, with a consentOperation of request or cancel
   respectively.  It includes the URI of requesting user in the
   requesterUri and the target user URI in the targetUri.  If consent is
   only requested for a single room, the requester includes the roomId.
   The combination of the requesterUri, targetUri, and optional roomId
   represents the ConsentScope.  A cancel MUST use the same ConsentScope
   as a previous request.

   For a requestContent, the targetUri needs to be in one of the domains
   of the receiving provider, and the requesterUri needs to be in one of
   the domains of the sending provider.

   The response to a requestConsent request is usually a 201 Accepted
   (indicating the requestConsent was received), optionally a 404 Not
   Found (indicating the targetUri is unknown), or a 500-class response.
   The 201 response code merely indicates that the request was received.
   A provider that does not wish to reveal if a user is not found can
   respond with a 201 Accepted.  Likewise in response to a cancel which
   has no request matching the ConsentScope, a 201 Accepted is sent and
   no further action is taken.

   enum {
     cancel(0),
     request(1),
     grant(2),
     revoke(3),
     (255)
   } ConsentOperation;

   struct {
     ConsentOperation consentOperation;
     IdentifierUri requesterUri;
     IdentifierUri targetUri;
     optional<RoomId> roomId;
     select (consentOperation) {
         case grant:
             KeyPackage clientKeyPackages<V>;
     };
   } ConsentEntry;

   struct {
     IdentifierUri requesterUri;
     IdentifierUri targetUri;
     optional<RoomId> roomId;
   } ConsentScope;

   An updateConsent request is used by one provider to provide explicit
   notice from a target user at one provider that consent for a specific
   "requester" was granted, revoked, or preemptively denied.  In this
   context, the requester is the party that will later request
   KeyPackages for the target.  The request body is a ConsentEntry, with
   a consentOperation of grant (for a grant), or revoke for revocation
   or denial.  Like a request, it includes the URI of the "requesting
   user" in the requesterUri and the target user URI in the targetUri.
   If consent is only granted or denied for a single room, the request
   includes the optional roomId.

   A grant or revoke does not need to be in response to an explicit
   request, nor does the ConsentScope need to match a previous request
   for the same targetUri and requesterUri pair.

   For example, in some systems there is a notion of a bilateral
   connection request.  The party that initiates the connection request
   (for example Alice) would send a requestConsent for the target (ex:
   Bob), and send an unsolicited updateConsent with Bob as the
   "requestor" and itself (Alice) as the target.

   In a grant, the sender includes a list of clientKeyPackages for the
   target user, which can be empty.  For the case of a bilateral
   connection, a grant of consent with a matching ConsentScope often
   results in an immediate Add to a group.  If the list is non-empty
   this reduces the number of messages which need to be sent.

   For updateConsent the requesterUri needs to be in one of the domains
   of the receiving provider, and the targetUri needs to be in one of
   the domains of the sending provider.

   The response to an updateConsent is usually a 201 Accepted
   (indicating the updateConsent was received), optionally a 404 Not
   Found (indicating the requesterUri is unknown), or a 500-class
   response.  The response code merely indicates that the request was
   received.  A provider that does not wish to reveal if a user is not
   found can respond with a 201 Accepted.

      *NOTE*: Revoking consent for a user might be privacy sensitive.
      If this is the case the target provider does not need to send a
      revoke to inform the requester provider.

5.8.  Find internal address

   The identifier query is to find the internal URI for a specific user
   on a specific provider.  It is only sent from the local provider to
   the target provider (it does not transit a hub).

   Note that this POST request is idempotent and safe in the sense
   defined by Section 9.2.2 of [RFC9110].

   POST /identifierQuery/{domain}

   Consider three users Xavier, Yolanda, and Zach all with accounts on
   provider XYZ.  Xavier is a sales person and wants to be contactable
   easily by potential clients on the XYZ provider.  He configures his
   profile on XYZ so that searching for his first or last name or handle
   will find his profile and allow Alice to send him a consent request
   (it is out of scope how Alice verifies she has found the intended
   Xavier and not a different Xavier or an impostor).  Yolanda has her
   XYZ handle on her business cards and the email signature she uses
   with clients.  She configures her profile so that a query for her
   exact handle will find her profile and allow Alice to send her a
   consent request.  Zach does not wish to be queryable at all.  He has
   configured his account so even an exact handle search returns no
   results.  He could still send a join link out-of-band to Alice for
   her to join a room of Zach's choosing.

   The request body is described as:

   enum {
     reserved(0),
     handle(1),
     nick(2),
     email(3),
     phone(4),
     partialName(5),
     wholeProfile(6),
     oidcStdClaim(7),
     vcardField(8),
     (255)
   } SearchIdentifierType;

   struct {
     SearchIdentifierType searchType;
     opaque searchValue<V>;  /* a UTF8 string */
     select(type) {
       case oidcStdClaim:
         opaque claimName<V>;
       case vcardField:
         opaque fieldName<V>;
     };
   } IdentifierRequest;

   The response body is described as an IdentifierResponse.  It can
   contain multiple matches depending on the type of query and the
   policy of the target provider.

   The response contains a code indicating the status of the query.
   success means that at least one result matched the query. notFound
   means that while the request was acceptable, no results matched the
   query. ambiguous means that a field (ex: handle) or combination of
   fields (ex: first and last name) need to match exactly for the
   provider to return any responses. forbidden means that use of this
   endpoint is not allowed by the provider or that an unspecified field
   or combination of fields is not allowed in an identifier query.
   unsupportedField means that the provider does not support queries on
   one of the fields queried.

   enum {
     success(0),
     notFound(1),
     ambiguous(2),
     forbidden(3),
     unsupportedField(4),
     (255)
   } IdentifierQueryCode;

   enum {
     reserved(0),
     oidcStdClaim(7),
     vcardField(8),
     (255)
   } FieldSource;

   struct {
     FieldSource fieldSource;
     string fieldName;
     opaque fieldValue<V>;
   } ProfileField;

   struct {
     IdentifierUri stableUri;
     ProfileField fields<V>;
   } UserProfile;

   struct {
     IdentifierQueryCode responseCode;
     IdentifierUri uri<V>;
     UserProfile foundProfiles<V>;
   } IdentifierResponse;

      *TODO*: The format of specific identifiers is discussed in
      [I-D.mahy-mimi-identity].  Any specific conventions which are
      needed should be merged into this document.

5.9.  Report abuse

   Abuse reports are only sent to the hub provider.  They are sent as an
   HTTP POST request.

   POST /reportAbuse/{roomId}

   The reportingUser optionally contains the identity of the user
   sending the abuseReport, while the allegedAbuserUri contains the URI
   of the alleged sender of abusive messages.  The reasonCode is
   reserved to identify the type of abuse, and the note is a UTF8 human-
   readable string, which can be empty.

      *TODO*: Find a standard taxonomy of reason codes to reference for
      the AbuseType.  The IANA Messaging Abuse Report Format parameters
      are insufficient.

   Finally, abuse reports can optionally contain a handful of allegedly
   AbusiveMessages, each of which contains an allegedly abusive message,
   its franks, and its timestamp.

   struct {
     /* the MIMI Content message containing */
     /* alleged abusive content */
     opaque mimi_content<V>;
     Frank frank;
     uint64 acceptedTimestamp;
   } AbusiveMessage;

   enum {
     reserved(0),
     (255)
   } AbuseType;

   struct {
     IdentifierUri reportingUser;
     IdentifierUri allegedAbuserUri;
     AbuseType reasonCode;
     opaque note<V>;
     AbusiveMessage messages<V>;
   } AbuseReport;

   There is no response body.  The response code only indicates if the
   abuse report was accepted, not if any specific automated or human
   action was taken.

6.  Relation between MIMI state and cryptographic state

6.1.  Room state

   The state of a room consists of its room ID, its base policy, its
   participant list (including the role and participation state of each
   participant), and the associated end-to-end protocol state (its MLS
   group state) that anchors the room state cryptographically.

   While all parties involved in a room agree on the room's state during
   a specific epoch, the Hub is the arbiter that decides if a state
   change is valid, consistent with the room's then-current policy.  All
   state-changing events are sent to the Hub and checked for their
   validity and policy conformance, before they are forwarded to any
   follower servers or local clients.

   As soon as the Hub accepts an event that changes the room state, its
   effect is applied to the room state and future events are validated
   in the context of that new state.

   The room state is thus changed based on events, even if the MLS
   proposal implementing the event was not yet committed by a client.
   Note that this only applies to events changing the room state.

6.2.  Cryptographic room representation

   Each room is represented cryptographically by an MLS group.  The Hub
   that manages the room also manages the list of group members, i.e.
   the list of clients belonging to users currently in the room.

6.3.  Proposal-commit paradigm

   The MLS protocol follows a proposal-commit paradigm.  Any party
   involved in a room (follower server, Hub or clients) can send
   proposals (e.g. to add/remove/update clients of a user or to re-
   initialize the group with different parameters).  However, only
   clients can send commits, which contain all valid previously sent
   proposals and apply them to the MLS group state.

   The MIMI usage of MLS ensures that the Hub, all follower servers and
   the clients of all active participants agree on the group state,
   which includes the client list and the key material used for message
   encryption (although the latter is only available to clients).  Since
   the group state also includes a copy of the room state at the time of
   the most recent commit, it is also covered by the agreement.

6.4.  Authenticating proposals

   MLS requires that MLS proposals from the Hub and from follower
   servers (external senders in MLS terminology) be authenticated using
   key material contained in the external_senders extension of the MLS
   group.  Each MLS group associated with a MIMI room MUST therefore
   contain an external_senders extension.  That extension MUST contain
   at least the Certificate of the Hub.

   When a user from a follower server becomes a participant in the room,
   the Certificate of the follower server MAY be added to the extension.
   When the last participant belonging to a follower server leaves the
   room, the certificate of that user MUST be removed from the list.
   Changes to the external_senders extension only take effect when the
   MLS proposal containing the event is committed by a MIMI commit.

7.  Consent

   Most instant messaging systems have some notion of how a user
   consents to be added to a room, and how they manipulate this consent.

   In the connection-oriented model, once two users are connected,
   either user can add the other to any number of rooms.  In other
   systems (often with many large and/or public rooms), a user needs to
   consent individually to be added to a room.

   The MIMI consent mechanism supports both models and allows them to
   coexist.  It allows a user to request consent, grant consent, revoke
   consent, and cancel a request for consent.  Each of these consent
   operations can indicate a specific room, or indicate any room.

   A connection grant or revoke does not need to specify a room if a
   connection request did, or vice versa.  A connection grant or revoke
   does not even need to follow a connection request.

   For example, Alice could ask for consent to add Bob to a specific
   room.  Bob could send a connection grant for Alice to add him to any
   room, or a connection revoke preventing Alice from adding him to any
   room.  Similarly, Alice might have sent a connection request to add
   Bob for any room (as a connection request), which Bob ignored or did
   not see.  Later, Bob wants to join a specific room administered by
   Alice.  Bob sends a connection grant for the specific room for Alice
   and sends a Knock request to Alice asking to be added.  Finally,
   Cathy could send a connection grant for Bob (even if Bob did not
   initiate a connection request to Cathy), and Alice could recognize
   Cathy on the system and send a connection revoke for her
   preemptively.

      *NOTE*: Many providers use additional factors to apply default
      consent within their service such as a user belonging to a
      specific workgroup or employer, participating in a related room
      (ex: WhatsApp "communities"), or presence of a user in the other
      user's contact list.  MIMI does not need to provide a way to
      replicate or describe these supplemental mechanisms, since they
      are strongly linked to specific provider policies.

   Consent requests have sensitive privacy implications.  The sender of
   a consent request should receive an acknowledgement that the request
   was received by the provider of the target user.  For privacy
   reasons, the requestor should not know if the target user received or
   viewed the request.  The original requestor will obviously find out
   if the target grants consent, but a consent revocation/rejection is
   typically not communicated to the revoked/rejected user (again for
   privacy reasons).

   Consent operations are only sent directly between the acting provider
   (sending the request, grant, revoke, or cancel) and the target
   provider (the object of the consent).  In other words, the two
   providers must have a direct peering relationship.

   In our example, Alice requests consent from Bob for any room.  Later,
   Bob sends a grants consent to Alice to add him to any room.  At the
   same time as sending the consent request, Alice grants consent to Bob
   to add her to any room.

8.  Security Considerations

   The MIMI protocol incorporates several layers of security.

   Individual protocol actions are protected against network attackers
   with mutually-authenticated TLS, where the TLS certificates
   authenticate the identities that the protocol actors assert at the
   application layer.

   Messages and room state changes are protected end-to-end using MLS.
   The protection is "end-to-end" in the sense that messages sent within
   the group are confidentiality-protected against all servers involved
   in the delivery of those messages, and in the sense that the
   authenticity of room state changes is verified by the end clients
   involved in the room.  The usage of MLS ensures that the servers
   facilitating the exchange cannot read messages in the room or falsify
   room state changes, even though they can read the room state change
   messages.

   Each room has an authorization policy that dictates which protocol
   actors can perform which actions in the room.  This policy is
   enforced by the hub server for the room.  The actors for whom the
   policy is being evaluated authenticate their identities to the hub
   server using the MLS PublicMessage signed object format, together
   with the identity credentials presented in MLS.  This design means
   that the hub is trusted to correctly enforce the room's policy, but
   this cost is offset by the simplicity of not having multiple policy
   enforcement points.

8.1.  Franking

   TBD.

8.1.1.  Example algorithm for generating franking keys

   To ensure a strong source of entropy for the franking_key included in
   each message, the client can export a secret from the MLS key
   schedule, for example with the label franking_base_secret and
   calculate the franking_key as the HMAC of a locally generated nonce
   and the franking_base_secret.

   franking_key = HMAC_SHA256( franking_base_secret, nonce )
